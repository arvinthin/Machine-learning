# Deep-Learning-Projects

Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: Artificial Intelligence !

Deep learning refers to artificial neural networks that are composed of many layers. Here we have a binary classification problem with the dataset containing a large number of images of Cats and Dogs and the task is to properly identify them to the correct class. We make use of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN's) which enables image classification at a high accuracy.In fact, Neural Networks are a hghly efficient class of algorithms for regression and classsification.
