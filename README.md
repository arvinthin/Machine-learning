# Deep-Learning-Projects

Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: Artificial Intelligence !

Deep learning refers to the learning using artificial neural networks that are composed of many deep layers. The layers can be input layers, many hidden layers and output layers. The field is  inspired by interconnected neurons in biological systems where in each unit receives a number of real-valued inputs and  each unit produces a single real-valued output. The strategy is to mimick the way neurons in human brain functions to do learning based activities, aiming to achieve highly efficent processing algorithms.

Here's a list of notebooks illustrating some of my current projects:
